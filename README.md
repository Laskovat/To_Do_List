# Simple To-Do List Application (OOP)

This is a basic to-do list application written in PHP using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows you to add tasks and mark them as complete.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
* **Mark as Complete:** Indicate when a task has been finished.
* **List Tasks:** View all the tasks in your list, with their completion status.

## Usage

1.  Save the provided PHP code as a `.php` file (e.g., `todo.php`).
2.  Run the file using a PHP interpreter, either through your web server or the command line (`php todo.php`).
3.  The example usage within the code demonstrates how to create tasks, add them to the list, mark them as complete, and display the list.

## Code Structure

The application consists of two main classes:

* **`Task`:** Represents a single to-do item. It has properties for the task title and its completion status. It also has a method to mark the task as complete.
* **`TodoList`:** Manages a collection of `Task` objects. It provides methods to add new tasks and list all the tasks with their status.

## Example

The example usage in the script creates a few tasks, marks one as complete, and then displays the current list.

## Further Development

This is a very basic implementation and can be extended with more features, such as:

* Deleting tasks
* Editing tasks
* Saving tasks to a file or database
* Adding due dates
* Prioritizing tasks
